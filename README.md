# machine-admin
A system settings panel for machine administration

## Introduction

[openUC2 OS](https://github.com/openuc2/os-rpi) (which runs on a Raspberry Pi computer)
provides the Cockpit system administration panel, but that panel is behind a login screen and is
missing various functionalities. This tool provides a web browser interface for other
functionalities needed by customers who operate openUC2 instruments, such as:

- Wi-Fi network connection management (which relies on NetworkManager)
- Toggling remote assistance (which relies on Tailscale)
- Managing removable storage drives (which relies on UDisks2)
- Shutdown and reboot (which relies on systemd)
- (TODO) Software updates (which uses Forklift)

It is meant to be served from a reverse-proxy on port 80 along with all other network
services, configured as in [openUC2/os-rpi](https://github.com/openUC2/os-rpi).

TODO: include some screenshots of what this roughly looks like 🙂

## Usage

The machine-admin app is deployed as two separate processes:

1. A web server (`machine-admin server`), which runs as an unprivileged process.
2. A privileged sidecar (`machine-admin sidecar`), which can perform particular superuser operations on behalf of the web server.

### Local Deployment

First, you will need to download machine-admin, which is available as a single self-contained
executable file. You should visit this repository's
[releases page](https://github.com/openUC2/machine-admin/releases/latest) and download an archive
file for your platform and CPU architecture; for example, on a Raspberry Pi 5, you should download
the archive named `machine-admin_{version number}_linux_arm.tar.gz` (where the version number should
be substituted). You can extract the machine-admin binary from the archive using a command like:
```bash
tar -xzf machine-admin_{version number}_{os}_{cpu architecture}.tar.gz machine-admin
```

Then you may need to move the machine-admin binary into a directory in your system path, or you can just run the machine-admin binary in your current directory (in which case you should replace `machine-admin` with `./machine-admin` in the commands listed below).

Once you have machine-admin, you can launch the sidecar with root permissions on a Raspberry Pi:
```bash
sudo ./machine-admin sidecar
```

In a separate terminal, you can launch the server as the `pi` user on a Raspberry Pi:
```bash
./machine-admin server
```

Then you can view the server's landing page at <http://localhost:3001> . Note that if you are
running it on a computer other than the Raspberry Pi with openUC2 OS, then you will need to set some
environment variables (see below) to non-default values.

### Development

To install various backend development tools, run `make install`. You will need to have installed Go first.

Before you start the server for the first time, you'll need to generate the webapp build artifacts by running `make buildweb` (which requires you to have first installed [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Corepack](https://github.com/nodejs/corepack)). Then you can start the server by running `make run` with the appropriate environment variables (see below); or you can run `make runlive` so that your edits to template files will be reflected after you refresh the corresponding pages in your web browser. You will need to have installed golang first. Any time you modify the webapp files (in the web/app directory), you'll need to run `make buildweb` again to rebuild the bundled CSS and JS.

### Building

Because the build pipeline builds Docker images, you will need to either have Docker Desktop or (on Ubuntu) to have installed QEMU (either with qemu-user-static from apt or by running [tonistiigi/binfmt](https://hub.docker.com/r/tonistiigi/binfmt)). You will need a version of Docker with buildx support.

To execute the full build pipeline, run `make`; to build the docker images, run `make buildall`. Note that `make buildall` will also automatically regenerate the webapp build artifacts, which means you also need to have first installed Node.js as described in the "Development" section. The resulting built binaries can be found in directories within the dist directory corresponding to OS and CPU architecture (e.g. `./dist/machine-admin_linux_arm64/machine-admin`)

## Environment Variables

### Shared

#### Sidecar Address

By default the sidecar binds to TCP port `2312` of `127.0.0.1`. You can bind to a different address (e.g. to a different port, or to a port on `0.0.0.0`, or to a socket file) using the `SIDECAR_ADDRESS` variable. For example, you could bind to TCP port `2313` of `0.0.0.0` by running the following command:
```bash
# For the sidecar:
sudo SIDECAR_ADDRESS="tcp:0.0.0.0:2313" ./machine-admin sidecar
# For the server:
SIDECAR_ADDRESS="tcp:0.0.0.0:2313" ./machine-admin server
```

### Server-Specific

#### Custom Templates

You can override the default webpage templates embedded in the machine-admin binary by providing a path to the templates directory with the `TEMPLATES_PATH` variable, relative to the current working directory in which you start the machine-admin program. For example, you could provide a custom home page by creating a new file named `home.page.tmpl` with following contents in a new `custom-templates/home` subdirectory in the directory from which you will launch machine-admin:
```html
{{template "shared/base.layout.tmpl" .}}

{{define "title" -}}
  Machine administration
{{- end}}
{{define "description"}}Machine system settings{{end}}

{{define "content"}}
  <main>
    <section class="section content">
      <div class="container">
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <p>
          Greetings from a custom template!
        </p>
    </section>
  </main>
{{end}}
```

and then running the following command:
```bash
# If you downloaded a machine-admin binary:
TEMPLATES_PATH=custom-templates ./machine-admin server
# If you are developing the project:
TEMPLATES_PATH=custom-templates make run-server
```

#### HTTP Server

You can override the default port (`3001`) or base path (`/`) of the HTTP server with the `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTP_BASEPATH` environment variables, respectively. For example, you could run the web server on port 3002 with base path `/admin/panel/` by running the following command:
```bash
# If you downloaded a machine-admin binary:
HTTP_PORT=3002 HTTP_BASEPATH="/admin/panel/" ./machine-admin server
# If you are developing the project:
HTTP_PORT=3002 HTTP_BASEPATH="/admin/panel/" make run-server
```
Note that `HTTP_BASEPATH` should end with a trailing slash.

#### Action Cable

Action Cable is used to push live page updates to web browsers without the need for page refreshes. Action Cable subscriptions are signed with a hash key for security reasons; that hash key will need to be persisted in a keyfile in order for web browsers to maintain subscriptions across restarts of the machine-admin server. You should override the default path of that keyfile (`/tmp/action-cable.key`) with the `ACTIONCABLE_HASH_KEYFILE` environment variable. For example, you could run the web server with a keyfile in the HOME directory by running the following command:
```bash
# If you downloaded a machine-admin binary:
ACTIONCABLE_HASH_KEYFILE="~/.config/machine-admin/action-cable-hash.key" ./machine-admin server
# If you are developing the project:
ACTIONCABLE_HASH_KEYFILE="~/.config/machine-admin/action-cable-hash.key" make run-server
```

If the file doesn't exist, a new key will be randomly generated and saved to the file.

## Embedding

Webpages can be embedded in other websites as iframes. For this, you may want to add the following GET query params to the webpage URL for the iframe:
- `nav`: `hidden` to prevent the navbar from being displayed
- `theme`: `dark` or `light` to override the theme settings saved in the localStorage of the user's web browser
- `mode`: `minimal` to hide page content which may be unhelpful for embedding

For example, your iframe could embed a URL like: `/admin/panel/internet?nav=hidden&theme=dark`.
